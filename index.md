I'm a Researcher in my second Postdoc at [PUC-Rio](https://www.puc-rio.br/english/ "PUC-Rio's Homepage"), supervised by [Hélio Lopes](http://www-di.inf.puc-rio.br/~lopes/ "Hélio Lopes's Homepage").

My first Postdoc was at [IMPA](https://impa.br/en_US/ "IMPA's Homepage"), supervised by [Luiz Velho](http://lvelho.impa.br/ "Luiz Velho's Homepage").

My research interests are mostly related with real-time Computer Graphics, Virtual Reality, Games and Machine Learning. My current focus is Real-time Ray Tracing and its applications in Virtual Reality, Non-euclidean spaces and Differentiable Rendering. I also work with R&D in real-world problems involving Data Science and Machine Learning.
